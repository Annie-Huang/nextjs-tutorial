CCS Module:
- can encapsulate each file use their own style file.
- devtool can see file name and class name under 'class' tag
- Cannot do nesting, need to write css style, e.g.
    .title a:hover,
    .title a:focus,
    .title a:active {..}
- Can only use pure selectors, meaning must contain at least one local class or id. Cannot select element
  (seriously? really??)

Lecture notes:

What is Next.js?
Framework for creating pre-rendering React websites
Offers us both Server Side Rendering & Static Site Generation (SSR) & (SSG)
- Server-side rendering is when react components are rendered into html pages on the server after a page request comes from the browser
- Static site generation is when components are rendered into html pages at build time so that we can just deploy the web pages and javascript bundles to the web
Next.js allow us to easily do both of these things meaning that our react components are already rendered into html pages by the time
they reach the browser
In contract to this with Next, react renders components in the browser instead and this is known as client-side rendering
